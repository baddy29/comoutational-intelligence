# computational-intelligence
Repo contains projects for practice of computational intelligence
This project aims to demonstarte the ability of genetic algorithms to efficiently address the optimization problems.
I have targeted three minimization functions - Rastrigin fucntion, Rosenbrock function and Sphere function for optimization using genetic algorithms.
